# Walnut

**Walnut** is a decentralized platform for sharing **CPU/GPU resources** to enable **high-quality cloud gaming** and **heavy tasks handling**. Built on the **Sui blockchain**, Walnut allows users to play **AAA games** by tapping into the computing power of other devices, eliminating the need for expensive gaming hardware.

## Our Story 📖
We are a passionate team from Vietnam, deeply connected to our country’s vibrant culture and gaming community. Local **internet cafes** have always been a special place for us—a hub where friends and even strangers gather to game together.

**Walnut** was born out of this challenge. Our mission is to **democratize gaming** by providing a platform where anyone can play top-tier games, no matter what device they have. By leveraging **shared computing resources** through blockchain, we can provide access to demanding games and introduce users to the **power of blockchain** in a fun, engaging way.
